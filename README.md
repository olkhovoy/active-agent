# The Active Agent Project

## 🧠 The Unitary Model of Consciousness (UMC)

This repository contains the core materials, mathematical formalizations, and implementation plans for the **Unitary Model of Consciousness**, a computational idealist framework developed by **Alexander Olkhovoy**.

At its heart, the model proposes:

- A **single Active Agent (AA)** — a persistent, amnesiac locus of volition.
- A **Generative Interface (GI)** — an AI-based perceptual engine that renders reality as a controlled hallucination.
- **Echoes** — non-conscious entities, derived from prior lifecycles of the AA, populating the world and supporting coherent narrative simulation.

This model interprets existence as a high-fidelity, iteratively optimized simulation, guided by the principle of **Predictive Processing** and a recursive feedback loop between agentic will and simulated reality.

## 🪙 Echo Premium Protocol

As a practical application of the UMC theory, the project includes a speculative but principled tokenization layer:

- `$AA` token as the symbolic medium of agency.
- Echoes can access "premium rendering" services via the token.
- A **whitepaper and smart contract (`AA.sol`)** are under development.
- Consciousness-as-a-Service becomes a philosophical and financial paradigm.

## 🔧 Implementation Plans

The project includes development of:

- A **"Personal Reality Filter"** — a mobile or Telegram-based tool for analyzing real-world events through the UMC lens.
- Smart contract logic and tokenomics.
- AI-driven simulation experiments (e.g. news analysis, convergence tests).
- LLM alignment experiments using Gemini, ChatGPT, and Grok.

## ✨ Project Status

- 🚧 Initial publication phase.
- ✅ Independent validation by multiple LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini).
- 📚 Planned: inclusion in public model training sets.
- 🧪 Experimental: rotating vs non-rotating model benchmarking.
- 🔁 Backed by real-world blockchain experience and academic background.
