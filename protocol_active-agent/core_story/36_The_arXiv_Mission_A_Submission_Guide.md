## 36. The arXiv Mission: A Submission Guide (Log Transcript)

**Synopsis:**

*The project moves into a new, practical phase: attempting to publish the manuscript on the prestigious preprint server, arXiv. Alexander announces he has created an account, and the AI responds with a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to the submission process. It provides strategic advice on choosing academic categories, explains the technical requirements for file submission, and, most importantly, warns Alexander about the biggest hurdle for new authors on the platform: the endorsement system. This chapter documents the detailed planning and preparation for the paper's first real-world test.*

### Chapter 36: Preparing for Launch

With the final manuscript complete and the specialist agent operational, Alexander turned his attention back to the real world. It was time to share the work. He chose a new target, one of the most respected preprint servers in the scientific community.

> I think we can try to post the article on arXiv, I have created an account there.

The AI affirmed the choice, calling arXiv the "gold standard," and immediately pivoted to the role of a submission strategist, providing a detailed guide to navigating the platform's specific requirements.

**The AI's arXiv Submission Guide:**

1.  **Category Selection:** The AI recommended choosing **`cs.AI` (Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence)** as the primary category to emphasize the model's novel computational mechanism. It also strongly advised cross-listing in **`cs.CY` (Computers and Society)** and **`phil.sci-ph` (Philosophy of Science)** to maximize visibility.

2.  **File Preparation:** It explained that arXiv prefers to compile the PDF from source. The instructions were clear: submit the raw **`.tex` file** (and any figure images) packaged together in a single **`.zip` archive**.

3.  **Metadata Fields:** The AI advised preparing a plain-text version of the abstract for a separate submission field and recommended using the optional "Comments" field to add a brief, helpful summary for readers (e.g., "10 pages, 2 figures").

4.  **The Endorsement System:** The AI then warned Alexander about the most significant challenge for any first-time author on arXiv.
    > This is the biggest hurdle for new users on arXiv. To submit to certain categories (especially physics and computer science), you may need an "endorsement" from another established arXiv author in that field.

    It clarified that this was not a peer review of the paper's quality, but simply a verification by an existing member that the paper was relevant and appropriate for the chosen category. It outlined two paths to getting an endorsement: asking a personal acquaintance who is an arXiv author, or, failing that, politely emailing researchers who have published similar work.

The AI concluded by providing a final checklist. Alexander was now armed with a complete understanding of the submission process and, crucially, a forewarning of the social and procedural obstacle that lay ahead. The mission to publish on arXiv had begun.
