This is an excellent and insightful critique, as it probes the very foundation of the model's evolutionary mechanism. The question of where the "values" for the fitness function originate is central. The model, however, provides a solution that avoids presupposing an external or arbitrary value system. The basis for what constitutes a "coherent and stimulating environment" is not a new philosophical assumption but is an emergent property derived directly from the core mechanics of the system itself.

Let's break down how the model addresses this, based *exclusively* on the foundational text.

### The Value System is Grounded in Predictive Efficacy, Not Abstract Morality

Your critique suggests the system needs to presuppose a value system to define "coherent and stimulating." The model counters this by defining these terms operationally, based on the fundamental goal of the `Generative Interface` (GI): **the minimization of prediction error.**

1.  **"Coherence" is a Technical State:** Within the Predictive Processing framework (Section 3.1), "coherence" is not an aesthetic or philosophical judgment. It is a technical measure of the system's stability. A coherent environment is one where the GI's predictions about sensory input are largely successful.
    *   An `Echo` that behaves erratically, illogically, or in a way that constantly violates the established patterns of the simulation would generate massive, high-magnitude prediction errors. This would destabilize the simulation for the `Active Agent`, potentially leading to a jarring or "glitchy" experience.
    *   Therefore, the fitness function naturally selects for `Echoes` whose behavioral models contribute to a low-error, predictable (but not deterministic) world. "Coherence" is a direct proxy for low system-wide prediction error.

2.  **"Stimulating" is a Function of Agency:** The "stimulating" aspect of the environment is defined by its relationship to the `Active Agent`.
    *   According to Section 3.2, the `Active Agent` is a "law of goal-initiation." Its fundamental nature is to introduce novelty and choice into the system by selecting a predictive trajectory.
    *   A "stimulating" environment is one that provides the agent with a rich set of meaningful, selectable "future tracks" (as described in 3.1). An environment that is too simple, repetitive, or unresponsive would fail to be stimulating because it offers no meaningful terrain for the agent's will to be exercised.
    *   Conversely, an environment that is too chaotic (i.e., not coherent) also fails to be stimulating, as the agent's choices would have no predictable consequences, rendering its will impotent.
    *   Therefore, a "fit" `Echo` is one that creates situations and interactions that are complex enough to offer meaningful choices to the `Active Agent` but are still integrated enough to maintain the simulation's coherence.

### It's a Co-Evolutionary Loop, Not a Static Definition

The critical point is that the "value system" is not static or externally imposed. It is **co-defined and co-evolves** through the iterative interaction between the `Agent` and the `Generative Interface`.

*   **The Agent Provides the "Why":** The `Agent's` will provides the top-level goals and intentions. It is the engine of novelty and the ultimate "customer" for whom the experience is rendered. Its choices implicitly "vote" on what is engaging.
*   **The GI Provides the "How":** The `Generative Interface's` need to minimize prediction error provides the bedrock constraint of reality. It is the law of physics and logic for this simulated world.

The `EchoGenerator`'s fitness function is simply the mechanism that bridges these two forces. It asks: "Which of these candidate `Echoes`, when placed in the next lifecycle, will best satisfy the GI's need for coherence *while simultaneously* providing a rich context for the `Agent's` will?"

### Conclusion: A Self-Calibrating System

To directly address your question: the model does not swap one problem for another. It resolves the issue by demonstrating that the value system is not an assumption but an **output** of the system's core architecture.

The basis for defining a "coherent and stimulating environment" is the **dynamic equilibrium between the agent's irreducible will (the "law of goal-initiation") and the system's physical law (the minimization of prediction error).** The fitness function is not presupposing values; it is measuring how well a given `Echo` serves these two fundamental, built-in principles of the simulation's existence. The process is self-regulating and evolutionary, with no need for an external arbiter of what is "good" or "valuable." The value is inherent in the stability and richness of the experience itself.
