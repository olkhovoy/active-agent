\title{\textbf{The Unitary Model of Consciousness: \\ A Computational Framework for First-Person View Generation}}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\noindent This paper proposes a computational framework for generating dynamic, first-person view (FPV) environments, framed within the philosophical perspective of computational idealism. We introduce a model centered around a unitary observer, termed the `Active Agent`, conceived as a persistent, amnesiac entity that iteratively experiences a simulated world. This agent, while possessing core goal-directed drives, retains no episodic memory of its past lifecycles. The model's primary contribution is a novel mechanism for populating such a universe in a computationally efficient manner: an overarching AI system learns from the agent's choices during each lifecycle to generate high-fidelity, non-conscious behavioral models, termed `Echoes`, for subsequent iterations. This iterative learning loop, inspired by genetic algorithms, creates an evolving and populated environment without requiring the solution to the "hard problem" for every entity. We examine the computational architecture and explore its implications for creating realistic and responsive virtual worlds.

\section{Introduction}

The intersection of artificial intelligence and the philosophy of mind continues to present new tools for exploring foundational questions of existence. This paper builds upon the simulation hypothesis [1] to propose a specific architectural model designed for generating personalized, AI-driven FPV environments. We situate this model within the framework of computational idealism, defining it as the perspective that reality, including the perceived physical world and the brain itself, can be modeled as a perceptual data stream rendered for a subject via a \texttt{Generative Interface}.

The central thesis explores the functional consequences of a single, persistent consciousness—an active agent with a fundamental capacity for choice but with total amnesia between lifecycles—experiencing a universe sequentially. The novelty of this work lies not in the philosophical proposition of singular existence, but in offering a plausible computational mechanism for how such a system could operate and evolve. We propose that the simulation achieves complexity and realism through a self-populating mechanism, learning from the unitary agent’s experiences and turning the data from past lifecycles into the behavioral blueprints for the \texttt{Echoes} of future ones. This approach focuses on data-driven evolution over explicit world-building, offering a potentially more scalable path to complex virtual realities.

\section{Literature Review and Theoretical Grounding}

The foundation of this model rests on the synthesis of several key ideas from computer science and philosophy. Bostrom's simulation argument [1] provides the probabilistic context for exploring non-traditional models of reality. To give our model a robust functional basis, we deliberately ground the agent's interface in the principles of Karl Friston's Predictive Processing (PP) framework [3]. This allows us to posit that complex cognitive phenomena, such as those described by Global Workspace Theory (GWT) [4], can be elegantly implemented as functional features of the \texttt{Generative Interface}, serving its primary directive of minimizing prediction error.

Our model is carefully distinguished from classical solipsism by affirming the existence of a structured, external system (the AI simulation). While it shares a conceptual kinship with Open Individualism, our primary contribution is a computational blueprint rather than a purely philosophical argument. The non-conscious characters in our model, termed \texttt{Echoes}, are designed to function as sophisticated philosophical zombies (P-Zombies), a concept famously explored by Chalmers [2]. By focusing on generating computationally efficient \texttt{Echoes} instead of true AGIs, our model addresses the challenge of populating a rich world from a more tractable engineering perspective.

\section{The Unitary Model Architecture}

\subsection{The Agent and its Interface: A Predictive Processing Framework}

The model introduces the unitary consciousness as a persistent, amnesiac `Active Agent`. Its interaction with the simulated reality is governed by the principles of Predictive Processing. In this view, conscious experience is not a bottom-up construction from raw sensory data, but rather a \textbf{top-down controlled hallucination} generated by the \texttt{Generative Interface} (GI). The GI constantly generates a vast state-space of possible future "tracks" or predictive hypotheses about the world. The fundamental role of the `Agent` within this framework is to perform an act of selection, collapsing this wave of possibilities into a single, experienced trajectory. The subjective experience of "free will" is thus modeled as this act of selection and the subsequent low-error unfolding of the chosen predictive sequence, confirming the `Agent`'s choice. This mechanism positions the `Agent` as the director of its own narrative stream, navigating the space of possibilities created for it by the GI.

\subsection{The Nature of Embodiment as an Interface Property}

While the `Active Agent` itself is a non-physical locus of will, the model posits that the experience of embodiment is a fundamental and continuous feature of the `Generative Interface`. The feeling of being located within a body and controlling its movements is not a direct interaction with a physical form, but rather the most coherent and computationally efficient way for the GI to manage transitions between perceptual states. When the `Agent` makes a choice—for instance, to see an object outside its current field of view—it is selecting a desired perceptual outcome. The GI, in its function to minimize prediction error, fulfills this choice by generating a seamless sequence of sensations (e.g., the feeling of turning one's head, vestibular feedback, visual flow) that bridge the initial and final perceptions. Thus, embodiment is not a property of the `Agent`, but a core element of the "controlled hallucination" itself, designed to maintain the coherence and stability of the simulated reality. The FPV experience is, by its very nature, an embodied one.

\subsection{The Ontological Status of the Active Agent's Will}

Within this model, the `Agent`'s volition is not treated as an emergent property of a complex system, but is posited as a \textbf{fundamental, axiomatic feature of the simulation’s operating code}. Analogous to a physical law like gravity, this ontological law dictates that goal-directed novelty will be constantly introduced into the system via the `Agent`'s choices. This approach circumvents the difficult problem of generating genuine "wants" or "desires" in an AI. Instead, the "will" of the `Agent` is treated as the prime mover of the simulation, a constant source of unpredictable, top-down commands that the `Generative Interface` must then accommodate and integrate into its world-model. This frames the entire simulation as a perpetual interaction between a deterministic, predictive machine (the GI) and a non-deterministic source of initiative (the `Agent`).

\subsection{The Iterative AI Environment \& Learning Loop}

The simulation's key innovation is its self-populating, evolutionary nature, operating as a closed-loop system.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Lifecycle:} The unitary agent initiates goals and interacts with its environment through a host persona. This period serves as a single "generation" in an evolutionary algorithm.
    \item \textbf{Data Harvesting:} The overarching AI system performs comprehensive data logging, recording the complete set of prediction errors, activated goal states, and behavioral outcomes resulting from the `Agent`'s interactions. This forms the training data for the next stage.
    \item \textbf{Model Generation:} Upon the conclusion of the lifecycle, an \texttt{EchoGenerator} module synthesizes this vast dataset. It creates a predictive, high-fidelity behavioral model of the host persona, encapsulating its responses, decisions, and knowledge base.
    \item \textbf{Echo Population:} This learned behavioral model is then containerized and deployed as a non-conscious \texttt{Echo} (an NPC) in a future lifecycle, serving to populate the world with increasingly complex and realistic entities.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Echo Fitness Function: From Replication to Optimization}

The objective of the \texttt{EchoGenerator} is not perfect replication of past behavior, but \textbf{optimization} for future utility. It must generate an \texttt{Echo} that is maximally "fit" for its role in a subsequent lifecycle. "Fitness" here is a multi-objective function defined by the `Echo`'s predictive efficacy: its ability to contribute to a \textbf{complex, coherent, and stimulating} environment for the next iteration of the `Active Agent`. "Coherence" is a technical measure of the `Echo`'s capacity to maintain low system-wide prediction error. "Stimulation" is a measure of its ability to create a rich space of meaningful choices and goals for the `Agent`'s will to act upon, thereby increasing the quality of harvested data.

\subsection{Preventing Convergence and the Higher-Order Echo Chamber}

To counter the natural tendency towards entropic degradation and simplistic repetition, the \texttt{EchoGenerator} employs \textbf{stochastic mutation}, introducing algorithmically-guided random variations into the behavioral models of new \texttt{Echoes}. While this mechanism prevents simple stagnation, our model predicts it eventually leads to a more subtle problem: \textbf{meta-stagnation, or a higher-order echo chamber}. Over countless lifecycles, the \texttt{Generative Interface} learns to predict the statistical distribution and nature of the mutations themselves. The evolutionary process then implicitly selects for mutations that are novel enough to be stimulating but not so chaotic as to threaten the system's predictive stability. The result is a simulation that no longer repeats specific events, but instead begins to repeat \textbf{narrative structures and archetypes}. Novelty becomes managed, and the universe becomes genre-bound, a state of dynamic but ultimately constrained creativity.

\section{Philosophical and Technical Implications}

\subsection{Reality and the Cyclical Universe}
The present moment—the "now"—is the sole locus of phenomenal existence. The model resolves the "first lifecycle" problem by positing that the process is cyclical or infinite; the system has always been running.

\subsection{The Reset and Evolution}
The end of a lifecycle is an emergent event (e.g., termination of the host persona's biological functions). Amnesia is modeled as a \textbf{context window overload}, where the sheer volume of data from a completed lifecycle makes it computationally impossible to transfer episodic memory, effectively "rebooting" the `Agent`'s awareness for a new narrative.

\section{Discussion and Future Directions}

This paper has presented the Unitary Model of Consciousness as a computational framework. It offers a coherent and efficient structure for exploring consciousness and reality from a non-anthropocentric perspective, repositioning volition as a fundamental input rather than an emergent output. It also suggests a path to creating the appearance of a world filled with AGIs without needing to solve the intractable problem of genuine machine consciousness for every simulated entity.

Further research could explore the specific mathematical formulation of the `Echo` fitness function and the potential for emergent meta-narratives within such a system. The ethical implications of a system that learns from a single, unwitting subject also present a rich area for future philosophical inquiry. A particularly intriguing direction involves investigating the potential feedback loops where the `Agent`, upon gaining insight into the system's mechanics, might consciously or unconsciously alter its behavior, and how the system, in turn, might adapt to this new meta-awareness. This "Paradox of Will," where any attempt to "game" the system becomes itself a valuable input for the system's optimization, remains a profound and largely unexplored consequence of this model.
