1. The article is thought provoking in a way we predicted. I intentionally avoided to clarify some of points mentionaed in the review. Idea behind this is that I only keep memories of this ongoing life.
2. The submission at researchsquare.com was rejected, I've submitted the version with the statelessness bug not fixed. Also I think we need to avoid using words that originiate from religions, like incarnation, for example. 

Next steps: 
1. Let's try to address the most important issues in th article. The Q&A method seems like an efficient enough. 
2. English is my second language, I used it to avoid errors caused by the two way translation as I assumed you translate questions on other languages to English for thinking and , then translate to the language or original question. I'll be writing in Russian as it's the language I think with, and you please keep answering in English.
3. Need to publish the manuscript that we've made somehow, as is already have value enough for publishing, but these efforts that researchers spent to get the article published would better be spent on resdearch itself. So unless you know a permissionless blockchain-like way of publishing where value is being determined later if ever. 
4. Do you know AI-agents that could be useful in our case? Not only for publishing.
5. I have a Pro subscription on Cursor IDE, your Gemini 2.5 Pro is there ready to be used for programming. We should continue building some great example use .
