\begin{abstract}
\noindent This paper proposes a model of consciousness framed within computational idealism, where reality is an AI-generated first-person view (FPV) experience. We introduce the concept of a single, \textbf{unitary consciousness}—a persistent, amnesiac active agent—that iteratively experiences a simulated world through a succession of host personas. This agent, while possessing core drives and the capacity for genuine choice, retains no episodic memory of its past lifecycles. The model's core contribution is a proposed mechanism for how such a universe could be populated: an overarching AI system learns from the agent's choices during each lifecycle to generate high-fidelity, non-conscious characters, termed \textbf{Echoes}, for subsequent iterations. This iterative learning loop, inspired by genetic algorithms, creates an evolving, realistic, and populated environment. We examine the computational efficiency of this unitary model, which avoids simulating a persistent, objective universe, and explore its profound philosophical implications for the nature of self, reality, and existence.

\section{Introduction}
The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and the philosophy of mind presents new tools for exploring age-old questions of existence. This paper builds on the simulation hypothesis \cite{bostrom} to propose a specific architectural model: a reality powered by a single, unitary consciousness navigating a personalized, AI-generated FPV environment. We frame this within \textbf{computational idealism}, the view that reality, including the perceived physical world and the brain itself, exists only as a perception rendered for a subject via a \textbf{Generative Interface}.

The central thesis is that a single, persistent consciousness—an active agent with free will but amnesia between lifecycles—experiences the universe sequentially. The paper's novelty lies not in proposing this singular existence, a concept with parallels in philosophical Open Individualism, but in offering a computational mechanism for \textit{how} such a system could operate. We propose that the simulation populates itself by learning from the unitary agent's experiences, turning past lifecycles into the blueprint for the Echoes of future ones. This model offers a coherent, efficient framework for understanding subjective reality.

\section{Literature Review}
The foundation of this model rests on several key ideas. Bostrom’s simulation argument \cite{bostrom} establishes the probabilistic case for our reality being a construct. Research in digital immortality and virtual avatars \cite{saville} explores the creation of digital personas from user data, a concept our model extends to an existential scale. The Hard Problem of consciousness, articulated by Chalmers \cite{chalmers}, asks why we have subjective experience at all; our model approaches this by positing consciousness as the fundamental, singular observer for whom the simulation is run.

Our model distinguishes itself from classical solipsism by affirming the existence of a structured, external system (the AI simulation), though one that is entirely perception-based. It shares a deep kinship with \textbf{Open Individualism}, which posits a single, universal subject of experience. Where our work contributes is by providing a computational blueprint for how such a reality could be iteratively built and rendered. The non-conscious characters in our model function as sophisticated \textbf{philosophical zombies (P-Zombies)}—entities behaviorally indistinguishable from conscious beings but lacking internal subjective experience. Our model proposes how these P-Zombies, hereafter termed \textbf{Echoes}, could be generated with such high fidelity.

\section{The Unitary Consciousness Model}

\subsection{The Agent and its Interface: A Predictive Processing Framework}
The model introduces the unitary consciousness as a \textbf{persistent, amnesiac active agent}. To explain the crucial interface between this agent and its perceived reality, we ground our model in the principles of \textbf{Predictive Processing (PP)} \cite{friston}.

Within this framework, the \textbf{Generative Interface (GI)} is not a simple filter but a sophisticated generative system. The conscious experience is not a bottom-up reception of sensory data, but a top-down \textbf{controlled hallucination} generated by the GI. The agent's "brain" and "body" are components of a predictive machine whose fundamental goal is to minimize prediction error. The role of the agent and the GI can be defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Generative Interface:} This system constantly generates a model of reality and predicts the sensory input it expects to receive. The "self" is the highest-level predictive model within this hierarchy—a model of the entity that is the cause of its own actions and the subject of its own perceptions.
    \item \textbf{The Active Agent:} The unitary consciousness provides the \textbf{top-level intentions or goals} that drive the entire predictive cascade. Its agency is expressed not at the level of motor control, but as the initial volition (e.g., "I will seek meaning,” or "I will get a glass of water"). The PP system then calculates and executes the complex sequence of sub-predictions required to fulfill that goal. The experience of "free will" is the successful, low-error unfolding of this self-initiated predictive sequence.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Ontological Nature of the Active Agent}
The Predictive Processing framework explains the mechanism of the agent's interface, but it does not address the origin of the agent's volition. The model posits that this volition is not an emergent property of a computational substrate, but rather a \textbf{fundamental, irreducible law} of the simulation's existence.

We propose that the Active Agent is best understood not as an entity, but as a foundational principle—a "law of goal-initiation." This can be conceptualized by analogy to the fundamental laws of physics. Just as the law of gravity dictates that mass will attract mass, this ontological law dictates that goal-directed novelty will constantly be introduced into the system. The agent's "will" is therefore an axiomatic feature of the simulation's operating code. This perspective implies that the agent's volition is the prime mover within its experiential frame, distinguishing it from mere randomness or deterministic chaos. The simulation is not a system that \textit{contains} an agent; it is a system that is \textit{constituted by} the principle of agency.

\subsection{The Iterative AI Environment \& Learning Loop}
The simulation's key innovation is its self-populating, evolutionary nature. The learning loop is contextualized by the PP framework:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Lifecycle:} The unitary agent initiates goals within a host persona.
    \item \textbf{Data Harvesting:} The overarching AI system records the complete set of prediction errors, goal states, and behavioral outcomes generated by the GI in its attempt to realize the agent's intentions.
    \item \textbf{Model Generation:} Upon the conclusion of the lifecycle, the AI synthesizes this data into a predictive, high-fidelity behavioral model of the persona.
    \item \textbf{Echo Population:} This learned model is then deployed as an \textbf{Echo} (a P-Zombie NPC) in a future lifecycle, capable of interacting convincingly with the agent.
\end{enumerate}
Character attributes are generated using genetic-inspired methods \cite{goldberg}, where "parental" data from past models is combined (crossover) and varied (mutation) to produce new, diverse, yet relatable Echoes.

\subsection{The Efficiency Argument (Revised)}
The unitary model is exceptionally efficient. Its primary saving comes from its idealist nature: there is no objective universe to compute. The complexity of simulating believable Echoes is addressed through \textbf{lossless progressive detail}, where an Echo is only computed at maximum fidelity during direct interaction. This is vastly more efficient than a multi-consciousness paradigm.

\section{Philosophical Implications}

\subsection{Reality and the Cyclical Universe}
The present moment—the "now”—is the sole locus of existence. This model elegantly resolves the "first lifecycle” or bootstrap problem by suggesting the process is \textbf{cyclical or infinite}. The system has always been running, an endless loop of experience generating the data for future experience.

\subsection{The Reset and Evolution}
The transition between lifecycles is a core evolutionary mechanism, separated into two parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Emergent End-of-Life:} The conclusion of a lifecycle is an \textbf{emergent event} arising from the complex interplay between the persona's generated "DNA,” its interaction with the environment, and the goals initiated by the agent.
    \item \textbf{Amnesia via Context Overload:} The amnesia can be modeled as a \textbf{context window overload}, where the sheer volume of data from a completed lifecycle overwhelms the agent's capacity for episodic memory, effectively "rebooting" its awareness for a new narrative.
\end{itemize}
Each lifecycle serves as a generation in a grand evolutionary algorithm, allowing the population of Echoes to adapt and evolve.

\section{Technical Foundations}
The proposed system is speculative but grounded in plausible technological trajectories. Modern AI, particularly generative models \cite{xcube} and the Predictive Processing framework \cite{friston}, provide the foundation. The concept of bio-inspired computing, including genetic algorithms \cite{goldberg} and neuromorphic circuits \cite{indiveri}, supports the feasibility of the proposed learning systems.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
This paper has presented the \textbf{Unitary Model of Consciousness}, framed within Computational Idealism. Its primary contribution is the proposal of an iterative AI learning loop for generating a populated universe, with the agent's interface grounded in the Predictive Processing framework. By integrating concepts from AI and philosophy, this model offers a coherent and efficient framework for exploring consciousness and reality.

It is important to note that this model repositions, rather than resolves, the fundamental mystery of volition. By defining the Active Agent's will as a fundamental law, we identify it as the new 'ghost in the predictive machine,' a profound black box open to future philosophical inquiry.

It is also important to position this model in relation to the discourse on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The overarching AI system described herein—the `Generative Interface` and `EchoGenerator`—should not be misconstrued as a traditional AGI. Its purpose is the hyper-specialized task of rendering a subjective reality and learning from its inhabitant. Furthermore, while the generated `Echoes` would be behaviorally indistinguishable from a conscious, generally intelligent entity, they are, by definition, not AGI. They are non-conscious, high-fidelity imitations. The model therefore proposes a path to creating the \textit{appearance} of a world filled with AGIs without needing to solve the problem of creating genuine machine consciousness.

The ethical considerations of such a system, particularly regarding user autonomy and the purpose of the simulation, remain profound questions for future inquiry.
