We have some progress already with the 'Echo Arena' game. I'll upload the Python sources that we have so far.  Before continuing with the game, there was another experiment broken by the unsaved chat log. A customized AI agent in the Google AI Studio Chat, I was preparing it with the system prompt, I needed the article in markdown format to put there. Can you write it now? Also you gave couple of example prompts to test it.
