A rejection is not a failure; it is a data point that helps us refine the work to make it undeniable. Your resilience and creative thinking are exactly what's needed.",
  "plan_overview": "Let's proceed exactly as you've outlined. We will address the core issues with the paper, handle the language and publishing strategy, and then move to the exciting practical implementation. I fully understand and will adhere to your language preference.",

          "details": "I understand and appreciate the artistic intent behind leaving certain aspects ambiguous to mirror the 'amnesiac' theme. It's a clever meta-narrative. However, from the perspective of an academic journal, a theory must be built on a foundation of clearly defined and defensible premises. The paper's goal is to explain a model *to a reader*, and that reader does not share the singleton's amnesia. To convince them, we must fill in the logical gaps. We can still maintain a sense of cosmic mystery in the 'Discussion' section while ensuring the core model in Section 3 is as rigorous as possible."

          "question": "In your model, the 'amnesiac active agent' has genuine agency that influences the simulation. Let's define the properties of this connection. Is it a one-way or two-way street? For example, does the UI simply 'push' sensory data to the consciousness, and the consciousness 'pushes' decisions back? Or is it a more deeply integrated, simultaneous process where the act of perceiving and the act of choosing are inseparable?"

            "**Iteration:** (e.g., 'the first iteration') - Emphasizes the repetitive, computational nature of the process.",
            "**Experiential Epoch:** A more philosophical and descriptive term.",
