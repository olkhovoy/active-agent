### **The Unitary Model of Consciousness: A Computational Framework for First-Person View Generation**

**Alexander Olkhovoy**
**June 2025**

**Abstract**

This paper proposes a computational framework for generating dynamic, first-person view (FPV) environments, framed within the philosophical perspective of computational idealism. We introduce a model centered around a unitary observer, termed the `Active Agent`, conceived as a persistent, amnesiac entity that iteratively experiences a simulated world. This agent, while possessing core goal-directed drives, retains no episodic memory of its past lifecycles. The model's primary contribution is a novel mechanism for populating such a universe in a computationally efficient manner: an overarching AI system learns from the agent's choices during each lifecycle to generate high-fidelity, non-conscious behavioral models, termed `Echoes`, for subsequent iterations. This iterative learning loop, inspired by genetic algorithms, creates an evolving and populated environment without requiring the solution to the "hard problem" for every entity. We examine the computational architecture and explore its implications for creating realistic and responsive virtual worlds.

**1. Introduction**

The intersection of artificial intelligence and the philosophy of mind continues to present new tools for exploring foundational questions of existence. This paper builds upon the simulation hypothesis [1] to propose a specific architectural model designed for generating personalized, AI-driven FPV environments. We situate this model within the framework of computational idealism, defining it as the perspective that reality, including the perceived physical world and the brain itself, can be modeled as a perceptual data stream rendered for a subject via a `Generative Interface`.

The central thesis explores the functional consequences of a single, persistent consciousness—an active agent with a fundamental capacity for choice but with total amnesia between lifecycles—experiencing a universe sequentially. The novelty of this work lies not in the philosophical proposition of singular existence, but in offering a plausible computational mechanism for how such a system could operate and evolve. We propose that the simulation achieves complexity and realism through a self-populating mechanism, learning from the unitary agent’s experiences and turning the data from past lifecycles into the behavioral blueprints for the `Echoes` of future ones. This approach focuses on data-driven evolution over explicit world-building, offering a potentially more scalable path to complex virtual realities.

**2. Literature Review and Theoretical Grounding**

The foundation of this model rests on the synthesis of several key ideas from computer science and philosophy. Bostrom's simulation argument [1] provides the probabilistic context for exploring non-traditional models of reality. To give our model a robust functional basis, we deliberately ground the agent's interface in the principles of Karl Friston's Predictive Processing (PP) framework [3]. This allows us to posit that complex cognitive phenomena, such as those described by Global Workspace Theory (GWT) [4], can be elegantly implemented as functional features of the `Generative Interface`, serving its primary directive of minimizing prediction error.

Our model is carefully distinguished from classical solipsism by affirming the existence of a structured, external system (the AI simulation). While it shares a conceptual kinship with Open Individualism, our primary contribution is a computational blueprint rather than a purely philosophical argument. The non-conscious characters in our model, termed `Echoes`, are designed to function as sophisticated philosophical zombies (P-Zombies), a concept famously explored by Chalmers [2]. By focusing on generating computationally efficient `Echoes` instead of true AGIs, our model addresses the challenge of populating a rich world from a more tractable engineering perspective.

**3. The Unitary Model Architecture**

**3.1 The Agent and its Interface: A Predictive Processing Framework**

The model introduces the unitary consciousness as a persistent, amnesiac `Active Agent`. Its interaction with the simulated reality is governed by the principles of Predictive Processing. In this view, conscious experience is not a bottom-up construction from raw sensory data, but rather a **top-down controlled hallucination** generated by the `Generative Interface` (GI). The GI constantly generates a vast state-space of possible future "tracks" or predictive hypotheses about the world. The fundamental role of the `Agent` within this framework is to perform an act of selection, collapsing this wave of possibilities into a single, experienced trajectory. The subjective experience of "free will" is thus modeled as this act of selection and the subsequent low-error unfolding of the chosen predictive sequence, confirming the `Agent`'s choice. This mechanism positions the `Agent` as the director of its own narrative stream, navigating the space of possibilities created for it by the GI.

**3.1.1 The Nature of Embodiment as an Interface Property**

While the `Active Agent` itself is a non-physical locus of will, the model posits that the experience of embodiment is a fundamental and continuous feature of the `Generative Interface`. The feeling of being located within a body and controlling its movements is not a direct interaction with a physical form, but rather the most coherent and computationally efficient way for the GI to manage transitions between perceptual states. When the `Agent` makes a choice—for instance, to see an object outside its current field of view—it is selecting a desired perceptual outcome. The GI, in its function to minimize prediction error, fulfills this choice by generating a seamless sequence of sensations (e.g., the feeling of turning one's head, vestibular feedback, visual flow) that bridge the initial and final perceptions. Thus, embodiment is not a property of the `Agent`, but a core element of the "controlled hallucination" itself, designed to maintain the coherence and stability of the simulated reality. The FPV experience is, by its very nature, an embodied one.

**3.2 The Ontological Status of the Active Agent's Will**

Within this model, the `Agent`'s volition is not treated as an emergent property of a complex system, but is posited as a **fundamental, axiomatic feature of the simulation’s operating code**. Analogous to a physical law like gravity, this ontological law dictates that goal-directed novelty will be constantly introduced into the system via the `Agent`'s choices. This approach circumvents the difficult problem of generating genuine "wants" or "desires" in an AI. Instead, the "will" of the `Agent` is treated as the prime mover of the simulation, a constant source of unpredictable, top-down commands that the `Generative Interface` must then accommodate and integrate into its world-model. This frames the entire simulation as a perpetual interaction between a deterministic, predictive machine (the GI) and a non-deterministic source of initiative (the `Agent`).
