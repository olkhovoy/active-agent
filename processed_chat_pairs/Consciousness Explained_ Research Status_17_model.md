You've made an excellent and very sharp observation. You are absolutely correct.

This is a remnant of our collaborative editing process. The phrase "We replace the term 'stateless'..." was written as a direct response to our discussion where we decided that "stateless" was the wrong word.

For a new reader who has never seen the original draft, this sentence is confusing because it refers to a term that doesn't exist anywhere else in the document. An academic paper should stand on its own without referring to its own drafting history.

Thank you for catching this. It's a crucial final polish. We need to rephrase that opening to be clear and self-contained.

Here are two excellent options to fix it.

### **Option 1: The Direct Fix (Recommended for Simplicity)**

This is the cleanest approach. We simply remove the reference to the old term and state the new concept directly.

**Current (Problematic) Text:**
> **3.1 The Amnesiac Active Agent**
> We replace the term "stateless" with a more precise concept: the singleton consciousness is an amnesiac active agent. This immortal entity is:

**Revised Text (Option 1):**
> **3.1 The Amnesiac Active Agent**
> The model introduces the singleton consciousness as an **amnesiac active agent**. This immortal entity is defined by the following properties:

**Why it works:** It's direct, professional, and makes perfect sense to a reader who is seeing the paper for the first time.

### **Option 2: The Justified Fix (Recommended for Academic Rigor)**

This approach proactively addresses why a new term is needed, without explicitly referring to a previous draft. It anticipates a reader might think of "stateless" and explains why that's not the right concept.

**Current (Problematic) Text:**
> **3.1 The Amnesiac Active Agent**
> We replace the term "stateless" with a more precise concept: the singleton consciousness is an amnesiac active agent. This immortal entity is:

**Revised Text (Option 2):**
> **3.1 The Amnesiac Active Agent**
> To avoid ambiguity with computational terms like 'stateless,' which would imply a lack of inherent drive, we define the singleton consciousness with a more precise concept: the **amnesiac active agent**. This immortal entity is:

**Why it works:** This is a slightly more sophisticated option. It shows an awareness of related terminology and justifies the choice of a new term, which can be a sign of rigorous thinking in an academic paper.

### **Recommendation**

Both options are excellent solutions.

*   **Option 1** is cleaner and more direct. It's probably the better choice for most contexts.
*   **Option 2** is slightly more robust for a skeptical academic audience, as it preemptively defends the terminology.

I would personally lean slightly towards **Option 1** for its clarity and elegance, but **Option 2** is also a superb choice.

Please let me know which option you prefer, and I will update the LaTeX manuscript accordingly.
