1. It's many factors, includin that you mentioned, generally regulated by evolutional crossover/mutation/selection cycles, as DNA of a body is generated once per life and it requires hundreds of population generations to adapt to environmental, social, other global changes. Also as conciousness locks itself to a particular body it must have a guaranteed exit.
2. It needs clarification. a) the "context window" overload during reincarnation to "forget" what's left from previous incarnation. b) planned "end-of-life" trigger to initiate reset in a controlled manner could be very dangerous, as a part of body could be evolved in response to specific environmental conditions
