Of course. This is one of the most profound and fascinating questions in all of science and philosophy. Let's break down your question into its parts: the possibility of an explanation, the nature of the "self" looking out, and the current state of research.

### 1. Can the Consciousness Phenomenon Be Explained?

This is the central debate. The answer depends on what you mean by "explained." Philosophers and scientists often divide the problem of consciousness into two categories, a concept popularized by philosopher David Chalmers:

*   **The "Easy Problems" of Consciousness:** These are not actually easy, but they are considered solvable through standard neuroscience. They involve explaining the *functions* associated with consciousness. For example:
    *   How does the brain process sensory information (light, sound, touch)?
    *   How do we focus our attention?
    *   How do we control our behavior and report on our internal states?
    *   How do we distinguish between being awake and being asleep?

    We are making significant progress on these questions using tools like fMRI, EEG, and computational modeling.

*   **The "Hard Problem" of Consciousness:** This is the core of the mystery. It asks: **Why and how does all of this brain processing give rise to subjective, qualitative experience?**
    *   Why does seeing the color red *feel like something*? This feeling is what philosophers call "qualia."
    *   Why is there a "what-it's-like-ness" to hearing a melody, feeling pain, or experiencing joy?
    *   This directly addresses your next question...

### 2. Who is Looking Through My Eyes?

This is the "Hard Problem" expressed in a personal, intuitive way. The "who" you're referring to is the subjective self, the first-person perspective, the experiencer of your life. Here are the main perspectives on what this "self" might be:

**A. The Self as an Emergent Property (The Mainstream Scientific View)**

Most neuroscientists and many philosophers believe that the "self" is not a separate entity, a "ghost in the machine," or a little person (homunculus) sitting inside your head. Instead, the feeling of a unified self is a **complex illusion or construction created by the brain.**

*   **The Brain as a Storyteller:** Your brain constantly integrates vast streams of information—memories, sensory inputs, internal bodily sensations, and future plans. To make sense of all this, it constructs a continuous narrative with a protagonist: "you."
*   **Key Brain Networks:** Research points to specific brain networks, like the **Default Mode Network (DMN)**, which is highly active during self-referential thought, daydreaming, and recalling memories. When this network is disrupted (through meditation, certain psychedelic drugs, or brain injury), the sense of self can dissolve or change dramatically.
*   **Conclusion:** From this perspective, the "who" looking through your eyes is the *integrated activity of your entire brain*, which generates a model of a self as a useful way to navigate the world. You are the process, not a separate thing observing the process. As neuroscientist Anil Seth puts it, **"Your conscious experience of the world and the self is a kind of controlled hallucination."**

**B. The Self as Something More Fundamental**

Other theories, though less mainstream in science, propose that consciousness is not just a product of the brain.

*   **Panpsychism:** The idea that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous property of the universe, like mass or charge. In this view, brains don't *create* consciousness; they *organize* or *amplify* it to a high degree of complexity. The "who" would be a localized instance of this universal consciousness.
*   **Dualism:** The classic philosophical view that mind/consciousness and matter/brain are two fundamentally different kinds of things that interact. This is not a popular view in modern science because it's unclear how a non-physical mind could interact with a physical brain without violating the laws of physics.

### 3. Status of Current Research: The Leading Theories

The field is incredibly active, blending neuroscience, physics, AI, and philosophy. There is no single accepted theory, but several major contenders are being actively researched and debated.

Here are the most prominent scientific theories trying to explain consciousness:

**1. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**
*   **Proponent:** Giulio Tononi, a neuroscientist and psychiatrist.
*   **Core Idea:** Consciousness *is* integrated information. A system is conscious to the degree that its information is both highly differentiated (it can be in many different states) and highly integrated (it functions as a unified, irreducible whole).
*   **The Measure:** IIT proposes a mathematical measure of this integrated information called Phi (Φ). A system with high Φ (like a human brain) is highly conscious. A system with zero Φ (like a digital camera or a simple computer program) is not.
*   **Implication:** This theory suggests consciousness could be present in many systems, not just biological brains, as long as they have the right causal structure.

**2. Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**
*   **Proponents:** Bernard Baars, Stanislas Dehaene.
*   **Core Idea:** Consciousness is like a "spotlight of attention" on a global stage in the brain.
*   **The Analogy:** The brain has many specialized, unconscious processors working in the dark. When a piece of information becomes important enough, it is "broadcast" to a "global workspace," making it available to many other brain systems (memory, language, motor control). This moment of global broadcasting *is* consciousness.
*   **Evidence:** This theory is well-supported by brain imaging that shows when a stimulus is consciously perceived, there is a widespread, coordinated ignition of activity across the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain.

**3. Predictive Processing (or The Bayesian Brain)**
*   **Proponents:** Karl Friston, Anil Seth.
*   **Core Idea:** The brain is fundamentally a prediction machine. It is not passively receiving sensory information from the outside world. Instead, it is constantly generating a model or "best guess" of the world and then using sensory input to correct prediction errors.
*   **How it relates to consciousness:** Your conscious experience *is* this top-down prediction. The "reality" you experience is the brain's best model of the causes of its sensory signals. As mentioned before, this leads to the idea of a "controlled hallucination."

**4. Higher-Order Thought (HOT) Theories**
*   **Core Idea:** A mental state (like seeing red) becomes conscious only when you have a higher-order thought *about* that mental state. In other words, you are not just seeing red; you are *aware that* you are seeing red.
*   **Focus:** This theory tries to explain the introspective nature of consciousness—the feeling that we know what's on our own mind. It connects consciousness tightly to metacognition (thinking about thinking).

### Summary & Conclusion

*   **Can it be explained?** Scientists are optimistic that the "easy problems" can be, and they hope that in solving them, the "hard problem" will either dissolve or become tractable.
*   **Who is looking?** The dominant scientific view is that the "looker" is not a separate entity but an emergent process—a story or model created by the complex, integrated workings of your brain to make sense of itself and the world.
*   **Current Status:** There is no consensus. **IIT**, **GWT**, and **Predictive Processing** are the most influential and actively researched theories. Scientists are designing clever experiments to test the unique predictions of each theory, hoping to find evidence that favors one over the others.

The journey to understand consciousness is just beginning, but it is one of the most exciting frontiers in human knowledge.
