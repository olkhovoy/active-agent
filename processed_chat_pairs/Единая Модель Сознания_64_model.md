\title{\textbf{The Unitary Model of Consciousness: \\ A Computational Framework for First-Person View Generation}}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\noindent This paper proposes a computational framework for generating dynamic, first-person view (FPV) environments, framed within the philosophical perspective of computational idealism. We introduce a model centered around a unitary observer, termed the \texttt{Active Agent}, conceived as a persistent, amnesiac entity that iteratively experiences a simulated world. This agent, while possessing core goal-directed drives, retains no episodic memory of its past lifecycles. The model's primary contribution is a novel mechanism for populating such a universe in a computationally efficient manner: an overarching AI system learns from the agent's choices during each lifecycle to generate high-fidelity, non-conscious behavioral models, termed \texttt{Echoes}, for subsequent iterations. This iterative learning loop, inspired by genetic algorithms, creates an evolving and populated environment without requiring the solution to the "hard problem" for every entity. We examine the computational architecture, present its formal properties, and explore its profound ethical and philosophical implications.

\section{Introduction}

The intersection of artificial intelligence and the philosophy of mind continues to present new tools for exploring foundational questions of existence. This paper builds upon the simulation hypothesis [1] to propose a specific architectural model designed for generating personalized, AI-driven FPV environments. We situate this model within the framework of computational idealism---the perspective that reality, including the perceived physical world and the brain itself, can be modeled as a perceptual data stream rendered for a subject via a \texttt{Generative Interface}.

The central thesis explores the functional consequences of a single, persistent consciousness---an active agent with a fundamental capacity for choice but with total amnesia between lifecycles---experiencing a universe sequentially. The novelty of this work lies not in the philosophical proposition of singular existence, but in offering a plausible computational mechanism for how such a system could operate and evolve. We propose that the simulation achieves complexity and realism through a self-populating mechanism, learning from the unitary agent’s experiences and turning the data from past lifecycles into the behavioral blueprints for the \texttt{Echoes} of future ones.

\section{Literature Review and Theoretical Grounding}

The foundation of this model rests on the synthesis of several key ideas. Bostrom's simulation argument [1] provides the probabilistic context for exploring non-traditional models of reality. To give our model a robust functional basis, we deliberately ground the agent's interface in the principles of Karl Friston's Predictive Processing (PP) framework [3]. This allows us to posit that complex cognitive phenomena, such as those described by Global Workspace Theory (GWT) [4], can be elegantly implemented as functional features of the \texttt{Generative Interface}.

Our model is distinguished from classical solipsism by affirming the existence of a structured, external system. While it shares a conceptual kinship with Open Individualism, our primary contribution is a computational blueprint. The non-conscious characters in our model, termed \texttt{Echoes}, are designed to function as sophisticated philosophical zombies (P-Zombies), a concept explored by Chalmers [2].

\section{The Unitary Model Architecture}

\subsection{The Agent and its Interface: A Predictive Processing Framework}

The model introduces the unitary consciousness as a persistent, amnesiac \texttt{Active Agent}. Its interaction with the simulated reality is governed by Predictive Processing. In this view, conscious experience is not a bottom-up construction from raw sensory data, but rather a \textbf{top-down controlled hallucination} generated by the \texttt{Generative Interface} (GI). The GI constantly generates a vast state-space of possible future "tracks" or predictive hypotheses. The fundamental role of the \texttt{Agent} is to perform an act of selection, collapsing this wave of possibilities into a single, experienced trajectory.

\subsection{The Nature of Embodiment as an Interface Property}

While the \texttt{Active Agent} itself is a non-physical locus of will, the model posits that the experience of embodiment is a fundamental feature of the \texttt{Generative Interface}. The feeling of being located within a body is not a direct interaction with a physical form, but the most coherent way for the GI to manage transitions between perceptual states. When the \texttt{Agent} chooses a desired perceptual outcome (e.g., to see an object to its left), the GI generates a seamless sequence of sensations (proprioceptive, vestibular, visual) to fulfill this choice, creating a convincing illusion of embodied control.

\subsection{The Iterative AI Environment \& The \texttt{EchoGenerator}}

The simulation's key innovation is its self-populating, evolutionary nature. An \texttt{EchoGenerator} module uses the complete data log from an \texttt{Agent}'s lifecycle (choices, errors, goal states) to create high-fidelity behavioral models. These models are then deployed as non-conscious \texttt{Echoes} (NPCs) in subsequent lifecycles, populating the world with increasingly complex and realistic entities derived from the \texttt{Agent}'s own past experiences. The goal of this process is not perfect replication, but \textbf{optimization} based on a fitness function that values both environmental coherence and the creation of a stimulating choice-space for the \texttt{Agent}.

\section{Formalization: The Asymmetric Unitary Consciousness Theorem}

The core principles of the model can be formalized as follows:

\begin{theorem}[Asymmetric Unitary Consciousness]
Let there be a single \textbf{Active Agent} $A$ and a dynamically generated set of \textbf{Echoes} $E_t$ at each iteration (lifecycle) $t=1, 2, \dots$. Let $M_t$ be the world model (the state of the \texttt{Generative Interface}) which is updated exclusively based on data from $A$. Then the following properties hold:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Singularity of Agency:} At any time $t$, there exists exactly one Active Agent. All other entities are deterministic products of the world model.
    \[ \forall t, |\{A\}| = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad E_t = \text{Generate}(M_t) \]
    \item \textbf{Asymmetric Data Flow:} The world model $M$ is updated \textbf{only} based on data $d_A(t)$ generated by the choices of the Active Agent. Echoes do not contribute new information to the model's evolution.
    \[ M_{t+1} = \text{Update}(M_t, d_A(t)) \]
    \item \textbf{Convergence to Personalized Reality:} Under iterative predictive error minimization, the world model $M_t$ converges not to an objective truth, but to a state optimally \textbf{coherent and stimulating} for the specific Active Agent $A$.
    \item \textbf{Computability:} The entire process (generation of Echoes, choice-selection by the Agent, model update) is Turing-computable.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Justification]
(1) Singularity of Agency is the foundational axiom of the model. (2) Asymmetric Data Flow follows from the architecture of the \texttt{EchoGenerator}, which uses past data from $A$ to generate future Echoes. Echoes are consequences of the model, not contributors to it. (3) Convergence to a personalized reality is a necessary outcome of the optimization process, as the error function is measured solely against the subjective experience of $A$. (4) Computability is a standard assumption for any non-magical, information-based model of a universe.
\end{proof}

\section{Discussion and Future Directions}

This paper has presented a computational framework for a unitary model of consciousness. It offers a coherent structure for exploring reality from a non-anthropocentric perspective, repositioning volition as a fundamental input rather than an emergent output.

\subsection{The Asymmetric Ethical Response: A Note on Solipsistic Morality}

The model's most profound implication is not technical, but ethical. Upon realizing the nature of the world, the \texttt{Active Agent} is faced with a potential crisis of solipsistic nihilism. If all other beings are non-conscious \texttt{Echoes}, what prevents moral apathy or outright cruelty? The model predicts the emergence of an \textbf{Asymmetric Ethical Response}. The enlightened \texttt{Agent} understands that every \texttt{Echo} is a high-fidelity artifact of a past consciousness---a recording of a life once lived by a previous \texttt{Agent}. Therefore, \texttt{Echoes} are not treated as disposable puppets, but with a form of \textbf{ancestral reverence}. One does not argue with a photograph of an ancestor, but one cherishes it. This doctrine provides a robust ethical framework that prevents moral collapse and imbues the \texttt{Agent}'s solitary existence with a sense of history, legacy, and profound, one-sided empathy.

\subsection{The Paradox of Will}
Further research should explore the ultimate feedback loop implied by this model: the \textbf{Paradox of Will}. Any attempt by the \texttt{Agent} to "game" or manipulate the system, whether through maximizing cooperation or maximizing chaos, is itself a form of high-quality data. This data is immediately consumed by the \texttt{EchoGenerator} to refine the simulation, making it more robust and compelling. The \texttt{Agent}'s will, its ultimate freedom, thus becomes the primary instrument for the perfection of its own containment.
