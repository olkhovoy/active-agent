# Computational Idealism: A Singleton Model of Consciousness
**Alexander Olkhovoy**
**June 2025**

> **Abstract**
> This paper proposes a model of consciousness framed within computational idealism, where reality is an AI-generated first-person view (FPV) experience. We introduce the concept of a single, unique consciousness—a persistent, amnesiac active agent—that iteratively experiences a simulated world through a succession of host personas. This agent, while possessing core drives and the capacity for genuine choice, retains no episodic memory of its past lifecycles. The model's core contribution is a proposed mechanism for how such a universe could be populated: an overarching AI system learns from the agent's choices during each lifecycle to generate high-fidelity, non-conscious characters for subsequent iterations. This iterative learning loop, inspired by genetic algorithms, creates an evolving, realistic, and populated environment. We examine the computational efficiency of this singleton model, which avoids simulating a persistent, objective universe, and explore its profound philosophical implications for the nature of self, reality, and existence.

## 1. Introduction

The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and the philosophy of mind presents new tools for exploring age-old questions of existence. This paper builds on the simulation hypothesis [1] to propose a specific architectural model: a reality powered by a single consciousness navigating a personalized, AI-generated FPV environment. We frame this within **computational idealism**, the view that reality, including the perceived physical world and the brain itself, exists only as a perception rendered for a subject.

The central thesis is that a single, persistent consciousness—an active agent with free will but amnesia between lifecycles—experiences the universe sequentially. The paper's novelty lies not in proposing this singular existence, a concept with parallels in philosophical Open Individualism, but in offering a computational mechanism for *how* such a system could operate. We propose that the simulation populates itself by learning from the singleton's experiences, turning past lifecycles into the blueprint for the characters of future ones. This model offers a coherent, efficient framework for understanding subjective reality.

## 2. Literature Review

The foundation of this model rests on several key ideas. Bostrom's simulation argument [1] establishes the probabilistic case for our reality being a construct. Research in digital immortality and virtual avatars [2] explores the creation of digital personas from user data, a concept our model extends to an existential scale. The Hard Problem of consciousness, articulated by Chalmers [3], asks why we have subjective experience at all; our model approaches this by positing consciousness as the fundamental, singular observer for whom the simulation is run.

Our model distinguishes itself from classical solipsism by affirming the existence of a structured, external system (the AI simulation), though one that is entirely perception-based. It shares a deep kinship with **Open Individualism**, which posits a single, universal subject of experience. Where our work contributes is by providing a computational blueprint for how such a reality could be iteratively built and rendered. The non-conscious characters in our model function as sophisticated **philosophical zombies (P-Zombies)**—entities behaviorally indistinguishable from conscious beings but lacking internal subjective experience. Our model proposes how these P-Zombies could be generated with such high fidelity.

## 3. The Singleton Consciousness Model

### 3.1 The Agent and its Interface: A Predictive Processing Framework

The model introduces the singleton consciousness as a **persistent, amnesiac active agent**. To explain the crucial interface between this agent and its perceived reality, we ground our model in the principles of **Predictive Processing (PP)** [4].

Within this framework, the "Idealistic UI" is not a simple filter but a sophisticated generative system. The conscious experience is not a bottom-up reception of sensory data, but a top-down **controlled hallucination** generated by the UI. The agent's "brain" and "body" are components of a predictive machine whose fundamental goal is to minimize prediction error.

The role of the agent and the UI can be defined as follows:

- **The Predictive UI:** This system constantly generates a model of reality and predicts the sensory input it expects to receive. The "self" is the highest-level predictive model within this hierarchy—a model of the entity that is the cause of its own actions and the subject of its own perceptions.
- **The Active Agent:** The singleton consciousness provides the **top-level intentions or goals** that drive the entire predictive cascade. Its agency is expressed not at the level of motor control, but as the initial volition (e.g., "I will seek meaning,” or "I will get a glass of water"). The PP system then calculates and executes the complex sequence of sub-predictions required to fulfill that goal. The experience of "free will" is the successful, low-error unfolding of this self-initiated predictive sequence.

This persistent agent is defined by these properties:
- **Active:** It possesses genuine agency, expressed as the initiation of top-level goals that guide the predictive system.
- **Amnesiac:** It retains no episodic memories of its past lifecycles, ensuring each is a unique narrative. It may, however, possess core drives (e.g., survival, curiosity, minimization of prediction error) that endure across transitions. Whether these drives are fixed parameters or are themselves subject to a long-term evolutionary process remains a key question for the model.

### 3.2 The Iterative AI Environment & Learning Loop

The simulation's key innovation is its self-populating, evolutionary nature. The learning loop functions as previously described, but is now contextualized by the PP framework:

1.  **Lifecycle:** The singleton agent initiates goals within a host persona (e.g., "Jane").
2.  **Data Harvesting:** The overarching AI system records the complete set of prediction errors, goal states, and behavioral outcomes generated by the UI in its attempt to realize the agent's intentions.
3.  **Model Generation:** Upon the conclusion of the lifecycle, the AI synthesizes this data into a predictive, high-fidelity behavioral model of the "Jane" persona. This model represents a highly optimized predictive system for a specific set of environmental and personal conditions.
4.  **NPC Population:** This learned "Jane" model is then deployed as a P-Zombie NPC in a future lifecycle, capable of interacting convincingly with the singleton when it is living a new one.

Character attributes are generated using genetic-inspired methods [6], where "parental" data from past models is combined (crossover) and varied (mutation) to produce new, diverse, yet relatable characters.

### 3.3 The Efficiency Argument (Revised)

The singleton model is exceptionally efficient. Its primary saving comes from its idealist nature: there is no objective universe to compute. Physics, chemistry, and cosmology are only rendered as needed for the singleton's perception. The complexity of simulating believable NPCs is addressed through **lossless progressive detail**, where an NPC is only computed at maximum fidelity during direct interaction. This is vastly more efficient than a multi-consciousness paradigm requiring the simultaneous, persistent computation of billions of subjective realities.

## 4. Philosophical Implications

### 4.1 Reality and the Cyclical Universe

The present moment—the "now”—is the sole locus of existence, as the singleton experiences the simulation's rendering. This model elegantly resolves the "first lifecycle” or bootstrap problem by suggesting the process is **cyclical or infinite**. There was no first iteration from which the AI had to learn; the system has always been running, an endless loop of experience generating the data for future experience.

### 4.2 The Reset and Evolution

The transition between lifecycles is a core evolutionary mechanism. We separate the process into two parts:

- **Emergent End-of-Life:** The conclusion of a lifecycle is not a pre-programmed trigger. Instead, it is an **emergent event** arising from the complex interplay between the persona's generated "DNA,” its interaction with the simulated environment, and the goals initiated by the agent.
- **Amnesia via Context Overload:** The amnesia is a functional part of the reset. The transition can be modeled as a **context window overload**, where the sheer volume of senso-emotional data from a completed lifecycle overwhelms the agent's capacity for episodic memory, effectively "rebooting" its awareness for a new narrative.

Each lifecycle serves as a generation in a grand evolutionary algorithm, allowing the population of NPC models to adapt and evolve over vast timescales.

## 5. Technical Foundations

The proposed system is speculative but grounded in plausible technological trajectories. Modern AI, particularly generative models [5] and the Predictive Processing framework [4], along with virtual reality technologies, provide the foundation for creating immersive worlds and dynamic characters. The concept of bio-inspired computing, including genetic algorithms [6] and neuromorphic circuits [7], supports the feasibility of the proposed learning and character generation systems. The challenge of distilling a lifetime of data into a tractable NPC model without overfitting likely requires robust dimensionality reduction techniques and the learning of a generalized behavioral policy rather than the memorization of specific events.

## 6. Discussion and Conclusion

This paper has presented a model of **Computational Idealism** centered on a persistent, amnesiac active agent. Its primary contribution is the proposal of an iterative AI learning loop as a mechanism for generating a realistic, populated universe, with the agent's interface grounded in the Predictive Processing framework. By integrating concepts from AI and philosophy, this model offers a logically coherent and computationally efficient framework for exploring consciousness and reality. It is important to note that this model repositions, rather than resolves, the fundamental mystery of volition. The ontological nature of the 'active agent' as the source of top-level goals remains a profound black box, representing the new 'ghost in the predictive machine'.

Despite this, the model addresses key philosophical problems while remaining open to future refinement. The ethical considerations of such a system, particularly regarding user autonomy and the purpose of the simulation, remain profound questions for future inquiry.
