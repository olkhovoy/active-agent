The model proposes a 'Predictive Fitness Function' to guide the evolution of Echoes. As a skeptical AI scientist, critique the computational feasibility of measuring this function. How can the system practically quantify an Echo's contribution to a 'coherent and stimulating environment' for the Active Agent in real-time? Argue that this measurement problem is just as intractable as the original replication problem.
