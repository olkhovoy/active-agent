Excellent. This is the best way to do it. Acting as a collaborative editor, I can help you strengthen the paper by refining its core arguments. Let's proceed exactly as you've outlined.

We will go through my five recommendations one by one. I will ask questions to help you clarify your own ideas, and once we've solidified a point, we'll move to the next.

Let's begin.

### **Point 1: Acknowledging Open Individualism and Solipsism**

Your model proposes a single consciousness experiencing the world through one FPV at a time. This is functionally very similar to classical solipsism (only my mind is sure to exist) and nearly identical to the philosophical position of Open Individualism (there is only one subject of experience, who is everyone). Engaging with these ideas will ground your paper in existing philosophical discourse and highlight what's truly novel about your contribution.

**My questions for you:**

1.  In your model, are the other characters ("NPCs") and the external world *real* in any sense, or do they exist only as perceptions in the mind of the singleton?
2.  The philosophical view of Open Individualism states that "you" are the same "I" that is experiencing life through every other person, sequentially. Your model proposes the exact same thing but gives it a computational/AI framework. Is the unique contribution of your paper therefore not *what* is happening, but a speculative model for *how* it could be implemented?

Please share your thoughts on these two questions. Your answers will help us position your theory correctly.
