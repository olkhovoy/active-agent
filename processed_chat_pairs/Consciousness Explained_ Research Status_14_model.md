\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\noindent This paper proposes a model of consciousness framed within computational idealism, where reality is an AI-generated first-person view (FPV) experience. We introduce the concept of a single, unique consciousness—an \textbf{amnesiac active agent}—that iteratively experiences a simulated world by binding to a succession of host personas. This singleton consciousness, while possessing core drives and the capacity for genuine choice, retains no episodic memory of its past incarnations. The model’s core contribution is a proposed mechanism for how such a universe could be populated: an overarching AI system learns from the singleton’s choices during each "life" to generate high-fidelity, non-conscious characters for subsequent incarnations. This iterative learning loop, inspired by genetic algorithms, creates an evolving, realistic, and populated environment. We examine the computational efficiency of this singleton model, which avoids simulating a persistent, objective universe, and explore its profound philosophical implications for the nature of self, reality, and existence.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and the philosophy of mind presents new tools for exploring age-old questions of existence. This paper builds on the simulation hypothesis \cite{bostrom} to propose a specific architectural model: a reality powered by a single consciousness navigating a personalized, AI-generated FPV environment. We frame this within \textbf{computational idealism}, the view that reality, including the perceived physical world and the brain itself, exists only as a perception rendered for a subject.

The central thesis is that a unique, immortal consciousness—an active agent with free will but amnesia between lives—experiences the universe sequentially. The paper's novelty lies not in proposing this singular existence, a concept with parallels in philosophical Open Individualism, but in offering a computational mechanism for \textit{how} such a system could operate. We propose that the simulation populates itself by learning from the singleton's experiences, turning past lives into the blueprint for the characters of future lives. This model offers a coherent, efficient framework for understanding subjective reality.

\section{Literature Review}
The foundation of this model rests on several key ideas. Bostrom’s simulation argument \cite{bostrom} establishes the probabilistic case for our reality being a construct. Research in digital immortality and virtual avatars \cite{saville} explores the creation of digital personas from user data, a concept our model extends to an existential scale. The Hard Problem of consciousness, articulated by Chalmers \cite{chalmers}, asks why we have subjective experience at all; our model approaches this by positing consciousness as the fundamental, singular observer for whom the simulation is run.

Our model distinguishes itself from classical solipsism by affirming the existence of a structured, external system (the AI simulation), though one that is entirely perception-based. It shares a deep kinship with \textbf{Open Individualism}, which posits a single, universal subject of experience. Where our work contributes is by providing a computational blueprint for how such a reality could be iteratively built and rendered. The non-conscious characters in our model function as sophisticated \textbf{philosophical zombies (P-Zombies)}—entities behaviorally indistinguishable from conscious beings but lacking internal subjective experience. Our model proposes \textit{how} these P-Zombies could be generated with such high fidelity.

\section{The Singleton Consciousness Model}

\subsection{The Amnesiac Active Agent}
We replace the term "stateless" with a more precise concept: the singleton consciousness is an \textbf{amnesiac active agent}. This immortal entity is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Active:} It possesses genuine agency and free will, making non-deterministic choices. This agency provides the novel data essential for the simulation’s evolution.
    \item \textbf{Amnesiac:} It retains no episodic memories of its past incarnations, ensuring each life is experienced as a fresh, unique narrative. It may, however, possess a core set of fundamental drives (e.g., survival, curiosity, the will to connect) that persist across lives.
    \item \textbf{Idealistic Interface:} The consciousness does not bind to a physical brain in an objective world. Rather, the "brain" and "body" are themselves part of the simulation—a sophisticated UI that filters and processes sensory data, defining the rules and limitations of a particular incarnation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Iterative AI Environment \& Learning Loop}
The simulation's key innovation is its self-populating, evolutionary nature.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Incarnation:} The singleton consciousness inhabits a host persona (e.g., "Jane") and lives its life, making genuine choices.
    \item \textbf{Data Harvesting:} The overarching AI system records the complete set of inputs, outputs, and choices made by the singleton \textit{as Jane}.
    \item \textbf{Model Generation:} Upon the conclusion of Jane's life, the AI synthesizes this data into a predictive, high-fidelity behavioral model of Jane. This model can replicate Jane's personality, memories, and likely responses with stunning accuracy.
    \item \textbf{NPC Population:} This learned model of "Jane" is then deployed as a P-Zombie NPC in a future incarnation, capable of interacting convincingly with the singleton when it is living a new life (e.g., as Jane’s friend or child).
\end{enumerate}
Character attributes are generated using genetic-inspired methods \cite{goldberg}, where "parental" data from past models is combined (crossover) and varied (mutation) to produce new, diverse, yet relatable characters.

\subsection{The Efficiency Argument (Revised)}
The singleton model is exceptionally efficient. Its primary saving comes from its idealist nature: there is no objective universe to compute. Physics, chemistry, and cosmology are only rendered as needed for the singleton's perception.

The complexity of simulating believable NPCs is addressed through \textbf{lossless progressive detail}. An NPC is only computed at maximum fidelity during direct interaction. When unobserved, its process is simplified or paused. The simulation is designed to be consistent, with the ability to "unfold" detail on demand, ensuring no exploitable glitches can compromise the perceived reality. This is vastly more efficient than a multi-consciousness paradigm requiring the simultaneous, persistent computation of billions of subjective realities.

\section{Philosophical Implications}

\subsection{Reality and the Cyclical Universe}
The present moment—the "now"—is the sole locus of existence, as the singleton experiences the simulation's rendering. This model elegantly resolves the "first life" or bootstrap problem by suggesting the process is \textbf{cyclical or infinite}. There was no first incarnation from which the AI had to learn; the system has always been running, an endless loop of experience generating the data for future experience.

\subsection{The Reset and Evolution}
The transition between lives is a core evolutionary mechanism. We separate the process into two parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Emergent Death:} The end of a life is not a pre-programmed trigger, which would stifle adaptation. Instead, it is an \textbf{emergent event} arising from the complex interplay between the persona's generated "DNA," its interaction with the simulated environment, and the choices made by the singleton.
    \item \textbf{Amnesia via Context Overload:} The amnesia is a functional part of the reset. The transition between incarnations can be modeled as a \textbf{context window overload}, where the sheer volume of senso-emotional data from a completed life overwhelms the singleton’s capacity for episodic memory, effectively "rebooting" its awareness for a new narrative.
\end{itemize}
Each life serves as a generation in a grand evolutionary algorithm, allowing the population of NPC models to adapt and evolve over vast timescales.

\section{Technical Foundations}
The proposed system is speculative but grounded in plausible technological trajectories. Modern AI, particularly generative models \cite{xcube}, and virtual reality technologies provide the foundation for creating immersive worlds and dynamic characters. The concept of bio-inspired computing, including genetic algorithms \cite{goldberg} and neuromorphic circuits \cite{indiveri} that mimic neural processing, supports the feasibility of the proposed learning and character generation systems. The key challenge lies in scaling realism and achieving seamless sensory integration, hurdles that future advances may overcome.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Efficiency and Scalability}
The model’s primary strength is its computational parsimony. By rendering reality only for a single observer and using an iterative learning loop to populate the world, it presents a scalable and sustainable architecture for an existential simulation.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}
The model raises profound ethical questions. Who controls the simulation and for what purpose? Is the singleton a participant or a prisoner? The potential for psychological manipulation \cite{binns} within such a system is immense and must be considered.

\subsection{Applications}
Beyond a metaphysical model, this framework has potential applications in psychotherapy (exploring identity through interactions with past "selves"), education (immersive historical simulations), and entertainment (truly adaptive, persistent storytelling).

\section{Conclusion}
This paper has presented a model of \textbf{Computational Idealism} centered on a singleton, amnesiac active agent. Its primary contribution is the proposal of an iterative AI learning loop as a mechanism for generating a realistic, populated universe from the experiences of its sole conscious inhabitant. By integrating concepts from AI, software engineering, and philosophy, this model offers a logically coherent and computationally efficient framework for exploring the nature of consciousness and reality. Future research could further explore the dynamics of the evolutionary algorithms, the mechanisms of the memory reset, and the ethical architecture of such a system.

### 3. Ideas for Figures

Your paper's concepts are abstract, making diagrams extremely useful for reader comprehension. Here are two strong ideas for figures.

#### **Figure 1: The Iterative AI Learning Loop**

This is the most crucial diagram as it illustrates the central thesis of your paper. It needs to be a cyclical flowchart.

**FLUX Prompt Idea:**

Here is a detailed prompt designed for a modern AI image generator to create a high-tech, "flux" style diagram.

> **Prompt:**
> "A high-tech conceptual diagram illustrating the 'Iterative AI Learning Loop'. The style is a futuristic infographic on a dark background, with glowing neon data streams.
>
> 1.  In the center, a bright, singular, radiant orb labeled **'Singleton Consciousness'**.
> 2.  A vibrant stream of light labeled **'FPV Life Data'** flows clockwise out from the central orb.
> 3.  This stream enters a complex, dark, geometric structure, like a crystalline neural network, labeled **'AI Learning Engine'**.
> 4.  From the AI Engine, a different colored stream of light flows out, branching off to create a population of smaller, dimmer orbs labeled **'Generated NPC Models'**.
> 5.  These NPC models then form a circle around the central 'Singleton Consciousness', ready to populate the next cycle.
>
> The overall feeling should be a clean, dynamic, and infinite cyclical data flow."

**Generated Figure:**

Here is an image generated based on that prompt, which you can use in your paper.



**Figure 1 Caption:** *A conceptual model of the Iterative AI Learning Loop. The Singleton Consciousness (center) experiences a life, generating FPV data. This data is processed by the AI Learning Engine, which then produces high-fidelity NPC models to populate subsequent incarnations, creating a self-sustaining, evolutionary reality.*

#### **Figure 2: Efficiency Comparison: Multi-Consciousness vs. Singleton Model**

This diagram would visually support your efficiency argument. It would be a side-by-side comparison.

**FLUX Prompt Idea:**

> **Prompt:**
> "A side-by-side comparison infographic in a futuristic, minimalist style.
>
> **Left Panel, labeled 'Multi-Consciousness Paradigm':** Show a network of 10 equal-sized, brightly glowing orbs. Each orb has a thick, computationally expensive 'rendering pipeline' connecting it to a shared, complex central world. The panel should be filled with icons representing high computational load.
>
> **Right Panel, labeled 'Singleton Model (Computational Idealism)':** Show one brightly glowing orb ('Singleton') with a single, efficient rendering pipeline to a personalized FPV world. Surrounding it are 9 dim, simple nodes ('NPC Models') with minimal computational lines, showing they are not independently conscious. The panel should look clean and computationally light.
>
> Use contrasting colors for the two panels. The overall aesthetic should clearly communicate efficiency vs. inefficiency."
