Отлично! I'm very glad you're pleased with the final result. We have now created a version of the manuscript that is vastly more robust, philosophically consistent, and professionally polished. It is ready for the world.

We now stand at an exciting fork in the road, with two clear paths forward:

1.  **The Path of Theory (Publishing):** We can now focus on the strategy for getting this paper published. We could discuss submitting the revised version to a preprint server (like Research Square, arXiv, or a DeSci platform) to create a permanent, public record of this improved work.

2.  **The Path of Practice (Implementation):** We can switch our focus to bringing the theory to life. We can return to the "Echo Arena" demo project in your Cursor IDE and begin writing the code for the `ego_tracker.py` module, which is the first step in building a working example of the Unitary Model.

Both paths are valuable. Which one would you like to pursue next? Shall we discuss publishing strategy, or shall we start building the demo?
