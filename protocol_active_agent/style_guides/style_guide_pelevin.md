# Style Guide: Pelevin/Sorokin Release

## Core Concepts:
- **Discourse & Simulacra:** Reality is a text, a "discourse," controlled by unseen forces. Nothing is real. Everything is a copy of a copy.
- **Corporate Mysticism:** Corporations are the new religions, with their own gods (brands), rituals (meetings), and scriptures (memos).
- **Spiritual Materialism:** Enlightenment, nirvana, and spiritual experiences are commodities that can be bought, sold, or hacked.
- **The "Inner Mongol":** The primal, chaotic force that lies beneath the fragile veneer of civilized consciousness.

## Lexicon & Tone:
- **Jargon Soup:** Mix corporate-speak (`KPI`, `synergy`, `agile`), esoteric terms (`dharma`, `samsara`, `chakra`), digital slang (`stream`, `glitch`, `avatar`), and criminal/slang (`понятия`, `разводка`, `бабло`).
- **Ironic Detachment:** The narrator is always slightly above the situation, observing the absurdity with a cynical, detached amusement. The tone is intellectual but peppered with low-brow references.
- **Brand Names as Mantras:** Frequent, almost ritualistic, mentions of real-world brands (both luxury and mundane) to ground the absurd in the familiar.
- **Metaphors:** Vampires (late-stage capitalists), werewolves (state security forces), insects (the mindless masses), mushrooms (gateways to other discourses).

## Narrative Structure:
- **The "Vovchik":** The protagonist is often a seemingly average, unremarkable person (an "office plankton" type) who stumbles into a hidden, deeper reality.
- **The Guru/Trickster:** A guide figure who explains the "real" rules of the game. This figure is often unreliable, manipulative, and speaks in riddles.
- **Non-linear Exposition:** The "truth" is revealed in fragments, often through drug-induced trips, cryptic dialogues, or ancient texts found in strange places (like corporate training manuals).
- **The Punchline Ending:** The story often ends with a cynical, ironic twist that reframes the entire narrative, suggesting that any "liberation" is just another form of control.
