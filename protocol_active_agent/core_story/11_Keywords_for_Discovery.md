# Protocol "Active Agent" - Core Story

## 11. Keywords for Discovery (Log Transcript)

**Synopsis:**

*The final piece of the submission package is addressed: keywords. Alexander asks for recommendations, and the AI provides a detailed, strategic list. It organizes potential keywords into three categories—Core Concepts, AI & Computation, and Philosophical Concepts—to ensure the paper is discoverable by all relevant academic communities. It then offers three curated combinations of keywords, each tailored to a specific audience, and recommends a balanced approach to best represent the interdisciplinary nature of the work. This chapter documents the final metadata optimization before the paper's release.*

### Chapter 11: Optimizing Metadata

With the manuscript and figures prepared, Alexander turned to the final, crucial step for ensuring his paper could be found by the right people in a sea of academic research: keywords.

> recommend keywords

The AI responded with a detailed strategy, explaining that the right keywords were crucial for discovery on academic search engines. It suggested a selection of 5 to 8 keywords, drawing from three distinct categories.

**AI's Keyword Recommendations:**

*   **Category 1: Core Concepts of the Paper**
    *   *Keywords:* Singleton Consciousness, Computational Idealism, Simulation Hypothesis, First-Person View (FPV) Experience, Iterative Learning.
    *   *Purpose:* To describe the unique model presented in the paper.

*   **Category 2: AI & Computation Concepts**
    *   *Keywords:* Artificial Intelligence (AI), Generative AI, Genetic Algorithms, Procedural Generation, Agent-Based Modeling.
    *   *Purpose:* To attract readers from the computer science and AI communities.

*   **Category 3: Philosophical & Psychological Concepts**
    *   *Keywords:* Philosophy of Mind, Consciousness, Solipsism, Open Individualism, Philosophical Zombies (P-Zombies).
    *   *Purpose:* To attract readers from the humanities, philosophy, and cognitive science communities.

To make the choice even clearer, the AI provided three pre-packaged combinations, each tailored for a specific audience.

**AI's Suggested Keyword Combinations:**

*   **Combination A (Balanced Approach):** A mix of keywords from all three categories, recommended by the AI as the best representation of the paper's interdisciplinary nature.
*   **Combination B (Prioritizing AI/Tech Audience):** Focused on terms like "Generative AI" and "Procedural Generation."
*   **Combination C (Prioritizing Philosophy/CogSci Audience):** Focused on terms like "Open Individualism" and "Philosophical Zombies."

The paper was now not only complete but also optimized for discovery. Every element, from the title to the metadata, had been collaboratively refined.
