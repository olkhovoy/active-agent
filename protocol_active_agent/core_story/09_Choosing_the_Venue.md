# Protocol "Active Agent" - Core Story

## 09. Choosing the Venue (Log Transcript)

**Synopsis:**

*The dialogue shifts to the practicalities of dissemination. Following the AI's strong recommendation to use a pre-print server, Alexander asks about alternatives to arXiv.org, mentioning he already has accounts on other platforms. The AI provides a detailed breakdown of the preprint landscape, explaining the specific roles of Research Square (a direct alternative to arXiv) and ORCID (a persistent researcher ID). It then recommends several other platforms, most notably PsyArXiv, as being the best thematic fit for a paper on consciousness. The chapter documents the final strategic decision before the theory's release.*

### Chapter 9: The Pre-print Landscape

With a publication-ready manuscript and a clear strategy, Alexander turned to the first, crucial step: choosing a pre-print server. He asked the AI for more details.

> What are other servers like arxiv.org, I have account at researchsquare.com and orcid.com

The AI's response was a comprehensive guide to the academic sharing ecosystem. It first clarified the roles of the platforms Alexander already used.

**AI's Analysis of Existing Accounts:**
*   **Research Square:** A leading, multi-disciplinary preprint platform and a direct, modern alternative to arXiv. The AI confirmed it was an "excellent and perfectly valid choice."
*   **ORCID:** Not a preprint server, but a "persistent digital identifier for you as a researcher." The AI explained its function as a unique ID to link all of a researcher's activities together, calling it the "glue that holds your scholarly record together."

The AI then provided a list of other major preprint servers, categorizing them by their specialty and highlighting their relevance to the paper.

**Alternative Preprint Servers Recommended by the AI:**

*   **Subject-Specific (Targeted Audience):**
    1.  **PsyArXiv:** Focused on psychology and cognitive science. The AI called this the **"best thematic fit"** due to the paper's focus on consciousness.
    2.  **SocArXiv:** Focused on Social Sciences.
    3.  **PhilSci-Archive:** Focused on Philosophy of Science.

*   **General-Purpose (Broad Audience):**
    1.  **OSF Preprints (Open Science Framework):** A massive, non-profit platform for all fields.
    2.  **Zenodo:** A catch-all repository run by CERN.

The AI concluded with a final, actionable recommendation, offering two clear paths forward.

**AI's Final Recommendation:**
> 1.  **Easiest Path:** Use your **Research Square** account. It's a top-tier platform, and you're already set up. It will serve your purpose perfectly.
> 2.  **Best-Fit Path:** Consider posting to **PsyArXiv**. The audience there is tailor-made for your topic, which could lead to more relevant feedback and faster discovery by the right people. (You can sign up for PsyArXiv via the OSF using your ORCID iD, so it's quite simple).
>
> Regardless of which server you choose, be sure to **link the preprint to your ORCID profile** to ensure you get credit for your work.

The plan was now complete. The theory was finalized, and the venue for its first appearance in the world had been chosen.
