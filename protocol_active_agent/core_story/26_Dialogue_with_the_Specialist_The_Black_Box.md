# Protocol "Active Agent" - Core Story

## 26. Dialogue with the Specialist: The Black Box (Log Transcript)

**Synopsis:**

*Alexander continues his interrogation of the specialist AI agent, posing the second diagnostic question about the theory's greatest self-admitted weakness. The agent once again proves its deep comprehension by correctly identifying the "profound black box" as the ontological nature of the Active Agent itself, quoting the paper's own conclusion to substantiate its answer. The dialogue confirms the agent's ability to perform critical self-analysis based on its source text.*

### Chapter 26: Interrogating the Ghost

Confident in the agent's basic understanding, Alexander moved to the second test prompt. This question was designed to probe its capacity for critical self-analysis—could it identify the known limits of the theory it was built upon?

> According to the paper's own conclusion, what is the biggest unanswered question or 'black box' that remains in the model?

The specialist agent answered with precision, quoting the source text to support its conclusion.

> Based on the paper's own conclusion, the biggest unanswered question—the "profound black box"—is the **ontological nature of the 'active agent' itself.**
>
> The paper explicitly states:
>
> > "It is important to note that this model repositions, rather than resolves, the fundamental mystery of volition. The ontological nature of the 'active agent' as the source of top-level goals remains a profound black box, representing the new 'ghost in the predictive machine'."
>
> In simpler terms, the model... does not explain **what the Active Agent fundamentally is** or **where its ability to create genuine choice (volition) comes from**.

The agent had successfully analyzed its own knowledge base and found the boundary of its understanding, just as the paper had designed. The test continued.
