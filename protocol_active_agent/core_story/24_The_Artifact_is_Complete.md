# Protocol "Active Agent" - Core Story

## 24. The Artifact is Complete: The Final Builds (Log Transcript)

**Synopsis:**

*Alexander gives his final approval. The AI proceeds to compile the master version of the manuscript, now titled "The Unitary Model of Consciousness: A Theory of Computational Idealism." It generates the complete, polished paper incorporating all revisionsâ€”the new terminology, the finalized core theory, and the AGI clarification. This definitive version is produced in both LaTeX and Markdown formats. At Alexander's request, the AI also provides a full, professional Russian translation of the final manuscript, bringing the theoretical development phase of the project to its official close.*

### Chapter 24: The Master Version

The time had come. All debates were settled, all terms polished, all arguments refined. Alexander gave the final command.

> Yes, produce the final manuscript in tex and markdown and then make a version in Russian

The AI executed the request. It took all the components they had built and integrated them into a single, coherent, and complete whole. The final manuscript, now officially titled **"The Unitary Model of Consciousness: A Theory of Computational Idealism,"** was generated.

This master version included:
*   The new, more academic title and refined terminology (`Unitary Consciousness`, `Generative Interface`, `Echo`).
*   The fully developed core theory, grounded in the Predictive Processing framework.
*   The new section `3.2`, defining the Active Agent as a fundamental law of the simulation.
*   The new paragraph in the discussion section clarifying the model's relationship to AGI.
*   All corresponding updates to numbering and references.

The AI produced three final artifacts:

1.  **The Final Manuscript in LaTeX Format:** A publication-ready version for submission to academic journals and preprint servers.
2.  **The Final Manuscript in Markdown Format:** A portable, easily shareable version for websites, blogs, or for use as a system prompt in other AI agents.
3.  **The Final Manuscript in Russian:** A full, professional translation of the final paper, ensuring the refined concepts were accurately conveyed in Alexander's native language.

*(Note: The full contents of these final documents are preserved in the dialogue logs.)*

The theoretical work was done. The artifact, the culmination of their intense, iterative collaboration, now existed in its finished form, ready for dissemination.
